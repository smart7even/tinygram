The project goal is to make a telegram clone with firebase backend.

The initial goal was to create cross-platform telegram client which would work with real telegram API but it is much more harder. I need more time and if I understand how to work with real telegram API then I will rewrite API layer to work with real telegram API because it makes much more sense.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create mobile telegram UI (initially with Android support only)
- [ ] Create messaging backend
- [ ] Add desktop telegram UI
- [ ] Rewrite API layer to work with real Telegram API
